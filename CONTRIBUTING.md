## How to Contribute

Bootique project happily accepts code and documentation contributions from the community. Use the normal GitHub
issue/pull request flow to submit your changes. Use [Bootique forum](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/bootique-user) 
to discuss your changes with other Bootique developers.

## So what do I need to do to get my pull request approved?

Other then technical merit of each pull request, we 
will ask for one more thing. You need to do it only once. We need a form from you that documents the terms of your 
contributions. This is how we can ensure that Bootique as a whole can be distributed under the Apache license. 
This protects you and protects all Bootique users.

Obvious contributions (such as fixing typos, reformatting the code, etc.) DO NOT require a CLA. Any changes in 
functionality DO require it. Please download a copy of the CLA form following the link below, fill in the information, 
sign, scan (or take a picture) and email it to the address specified in the form.
