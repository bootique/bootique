        <title>What is Bootique</title>
        <para>Bootique is a minimally opinionated technology for building container-less runnable
            Java applications. No JEE container required to run your app! It is an ideal platform
            for <emphasis><link xlink:href="http://martinfowler.com/articles/microservices.html"
                    >microservices</link></emphasis>, as it allows you to create a fully functional
            app with minimal-to-no setup. Though it is not limited to a specific kind of app (or the
            "micro" size) and can be used for REST services, webapps, runnable jobs, DB migrations,
            JavaFX GUI apps to mention a few examples.</para>
        <para>Unlike traditional container-based apps, Bootique allows you to control your
                <code>main()</code> method and create Java apps that behave like simple executable
            commands that can be run with
            Java:<programlisting language="bourne">java -jar my.jar [arguments]</programlisting></para>
        <para>Bootique was inspired by two similar products - <link
                xlink:href="http://www.dropwizard.io/">Dropwizard</link> and <link
                xlink:href="http://projects.spring.io/spring-boot/">SpringBoot</link>, however its
            focus is different. Bootique favors modularity and clean pluggable architecture.
            Bootique is built on top of <link xlink:href="https://github.com/google/guice">Google
                Guice</link> DI container, which provides the core of its modularity
            mechanism.</para>

        <title>Requirements</title>
        <para>Java 8 or newer is required. This is it.</para>
        <para>Bootique apps can be built using any Java build system (Ant, Maven, Gradle, etc).
            Examples in the documentation are based on Maven and <code>maven-shade-plugin</code>.
            While this is not strictly a requirement, Bootique apps are usually packaged into "fat"
            runnable jars and don't have any runtime dependencies beyond the JRE.</para>
